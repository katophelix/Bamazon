* item_id (unique id for each product)

* product_name (Name of product)

* department_name

* price (cost to customer)

* stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

* Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).

Next node prompts then users with two messages.
